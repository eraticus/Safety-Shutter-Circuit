# Safety-Shutter-Circuit
Circuit to shut shutter if too much light gets into dewar.
The project is separated into these components:
a) Sensor: photodiode and amplifier with comparator
b) ADC: connected to multiple sensors and shutter control
c) Shutter Control: connected to multiple ADCs, shutter, and RS232
